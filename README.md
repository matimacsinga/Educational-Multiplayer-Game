# Educational Multiplayer Game

Educational Multiplayer Game is a platform developed with the aim of allowing aspiring entrepreneurs to study and interact with each other by means of a 2D Game. With lessons in the form of quests and minigames, communication done using text, audio, and video chat, and assessments with quizzes and leaderboards, this project wants to give anyone interested in learning about entrepreneurship a more fun and easier to manage way into it.

## Description of Build

This build has the aim of showcase the main features of this project. You will be able to run the build in two instances from your computer to create two players, one as the server and user and the other one just as a user. With any of them, you will be able to experience what completing a lesson on the platform will feel like, as well as take a look at some other features that are implemented.

## Testing the Demo
 If you want to test the game with 2 players, you should open the project in Unity and create a build from there (since we were advised not to upload builds on the gitlab). If not, you can just open the project in Unity and run it directly. 
 You will be presented with a login screen and two buttons: one with login as host and the other to login as client. Below, I will provide you with four accounts already existent in the database for simplicity purposes. Firstly, enter one of the account's credentials and click login as host. You should be loaded into the game for that window. Afterwards, in the other window, you should enter the other account credentials and click the login as client button. If you have done these steps correctly, you should be able to see both players on both windows. From then, use whichever you like or both. The first thing you should do is look in the West direction, where you will find a figure of a girl. Interact with it by pressing "E" and it will explain what you need to do from then to complete a lesson and also test some features. Also, when interacting with another player, both of your cameras are opened directly. When testing from one laptop, you should have 2 cameras (one integrated and one external connected, for example). If only one of the cameras open, that is why.
